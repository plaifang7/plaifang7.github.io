## Welcome to PLFtheWDs Portfolio Page
I am an adaptable problem-solver and web developer who finds drive in learning. Given my prior experience in Project Management, I am able to assess different situations and determine what I need to do to succeed at a quick pace. As a constant quick learner, I have the ability to solve any problems that come my way and have determination to succeed no matter what obstacles are presented. As a developer, I can provide any team/company with an individual who is team-oriented, shows leadership when required, and is very ambitious. Let me provide assistance with the scary things your company faces on a daily basis because I am willing to do things that scare me every day.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/plaifang7/plaifang7.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
